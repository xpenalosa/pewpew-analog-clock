# PewPew Analog Clock display
Analog clock display using the [PewPew library](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/).

Yellow hand represents seconds (5s interval)  
Orange hand represents minutes (5m interval)  
Green hand represents hours (1h interval, 12h format)

P.S. Tilt your head 45Â° to the left. The display is 8x8 and it's hard to create a half-decent clock.
